            <h2>Intro to jQuery Mobile</h2>
    		
            <p>A Touch-Optimized UI Framework built with jQuery and HTML5.</p>
            <p>jQuery Mobile is the easiest way to build sites and apps that are accessible on all popular smartphone, tablet and desktop devices. For jQuery 1.7.0 to 1.8.2.</p>
            
            <p>jQuery's mobile strategy can be summarized simply: A unified user interface system that works seamlessly across all popular mobile device platforms, built on the rock-solid jQuery and jQuery UI foundation. Focused on a <a href="features.html">feature-rich</a> but lightweight codebase built on progressive enhancement with a flexible <a href="../api/themes.html">theming system</a> and <a href="http://www.jquerymobile.com/themeroller" target="_new">ThemeRoller tool</a>. </p>
            <p>The framework includes an <a href="../pages/page-navmodel.html">Ajax navigation</a> system that brings animated page <a href="../pages/page-transitions.html">transitions</a> and a core set of UI widgets: <a href="../pages/page-anatomy.html">pages</a>, <a href="../pages/dialog/index.html">dialogs</a>, <a href="../toolbars/docs-bars.html">toolbars</a>, <a href="../lists/docs-lists.html">listviews</a>, <a href="../buttons/buttons-types.html">buttons</a> with <a href="../buttons/buttons-icons.html">icons</a>, <a href="../forms/forms-all.html">form elements</a>, <a href="../content/content-collapsible-set.html">accordions</a>, <a href="../content/content-collapsible.html">collapsibles</a>, and more.</p>
    
            <p>The critical difference with our approach is the <a href="platforms.html">wide variety of mobile platforms we're targeting</a> with jQuery Mobile so no browser or device is left behind. We've also focused on making jQuery Mobile <a href="getting-started.html">easy to learn</a> with a simple, <a href="../api/data-attributes.html">markup-based system</a> to applying behavior and theming. For more advanced developers, there is a rich API of <a href="../api/globalconfig.html">global configuration options</a>, <a href="../api/events.html" id="" title="events">events</a>, and <a href="../api/methods.html" id="" title="methods">methods</a> to <a href="../pages/page-scripting.html" id="" title="page-scripting">apply scripting</a>, <a href="../pages/page-dynamic.html" id="" title="page-dynamic">generate dynamic pages</a>, and even <a href="../pages/phonegap.html" id="" title="phonegap">build native apps</a> with tools like PhoneGap.</p>
            
            <p>To make this broad support possible, all pages in jQuery Mobile are built on a foundation of <strong>clean, semantic HTML</strong> to ensure compatibility with pretty much any web-enabled device. In devices that interpret CSS and JavaScript, jQuery Mobile applies <strong>progressive enhancement techniques</strong> to unobtrusively transform the semantic page into a rich, interactive experience that leverages the power of jQuery and CSS. <a href="accessibility.html">Accessibility features</a> such as WAI-ARIA are tightly integrated throughout the framework to provide support for screen readers and other assistive technologies.</p>
    
            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            
            <p>jQuery Mobile is built upon standard, semantic HTML, allowing pages to be accessible to the broadest range of devices possible. For A-Grade browsers, many of the components in jQuery Mobile leverage techniques such as focus management, keyboard navigation, and HTML attributes specified in the W3C's <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">WAI-ARIA</a> specification.</p> 
            <p>By utilizing these techniques, we do our best to ensure an accessible experience to users with disabilities such as blindness, who may use screen readers (like <em>VoiceOver</em>, on Apple's iPhone device) or other assistive technology to access the web.</p>

            <h2>Key features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Built on jQuery core</strong> for familiar and consistent jQuery syntax and minimal learning curve and leverages jQuery UI code and patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Compatible with all major mobile, tablet, e-reader & desktop platforms</strong> - iOS, Android, Blackberry, Palm WebOS, Nokia/Symbian, Windows Phone 7, MeeGo, Opera Mobile/Mini, Firefox Mobile, Kindle, Nook and all modern browsers with graded levels of support.</li>
                <li><strong>Lightweight size</strong> and minimal image dependencies for speed.</li>
                <li><strong>Modular architecture</strong> for creating custom builds that are optimized to only include the features needed for a particular application.</li>
                <li><strong>HTML5 Markup-driven configuration</strong> of pages and behavior for fast development and minimal required scripting.</li>
                <li><strong>Progressive enhancement</strong> approach brings core content and functionality to all mobile, tablet and desktop platforms and a rich, installed application-like experience on newer mobile platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive design</strong> techniques and tools allow the same underlying codebase to automatically scale from smartphone to desktop-sized screens.</li>
                <li><strong>Powerful Ajax-powered navigation system</strong> to enable animated page transitions while maintaining back button, bookmarking and clean URLs through pushState.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility</strong> features such as WAI-ARIA are also included to ensure that the pages work for screen readers (e.g. VoiceOver in iOS) and other assistive technologies.</li>
                <li><strong>Touch and mouse event support</strong> streamline the process of supporting touch, mouse and cursor focus-based user input methods with a simple API. </li>
                <li><strong>Unified UI widgets</strong> for common controls enhance native controls with touch-optimized, themable controls that are platform-agnostic and easy to use.</li>
                <li><strong>Powerful theming framework</strong> and the <a href="http://www.jquerymobile.com/themeroller" rel="external">ThemeRoller</a> application make highly-branded experiences easy to build.</li>
                <li><strong>Customizable</strong> bundles for even better perfomance can be built easily with the <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/" rel="external">Download builder</a></li>
            </ul>
